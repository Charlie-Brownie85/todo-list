# ✅ ToDo list

Classic ToDo list app to practice and apply some of the latest Front End and Vue techs (at 2024 at least)

## 🤖 Main techs

- **Vue 3** (with **Composition API** and **script setup**)
- **Typescript**
- **Pinia** 🍍 for state management
- **postCSS** and **Tailwind** for styling
- **Vite** as build tool
- **Vitest** and `vue-testing-library` for unit tests
- `vue-i18n` for translations

### 🔩 Some extra techs

- Auto-import of components with `unplugin-vue-components`
- **Husky** 🐶 and `@commitlint` for some Git hooks and commit standards

## 🗝️ Key features

- App state persistance (with `pinia-plugin-persistedstate`)
- Dark/Light theming with tailwind and `@vueuse/core`
- Vue animations in tasks lists
- SVG icons dynamically imported and injected inline


#### Possible improvements:

- Language selector
- Add draggable?
- Add tooltip?
- Make items editable?
- Add e2e testing (playwright)?
